      "text/plain": "spell-checker owls perched on a branch of an oak tree. In the tree, there was a hole. And in the hole, there was a scroll.   \\n\\n\\t“I want to get this over and done with. Don’t look so worried. Soon you will be with your precious flower. Q of Alphabet village… Are you ready for the first question?” asked K. \\n\\n\\t“Yes.”     \\n\\n\\tThe three spell-checker owls nodded at each other. Clutching the edge of the scroll in its beak, an owl pulled the scroll out of the tree. The owl flew to the other side of the river, and it let go of the scroll when it was above K’s eager hands.  \\n\\n\\t“The thirteen questions... These were prepared by a committee of spell-checker owls. I had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all,” said K.\\n\\n\\tHe broke the red seal and unfurled the scroll. \\n\\n\\t“The first question is about the zero article. Is this correct? We believe in peace.” \\n\\n\\tThe word-pecker hovered above K. In its beak was the special grammatica flower. The bird bit hard into the flower’s stem.\\n\\n\\tQ cried out, “No!” \\n\\n\\t“This is going to be easier than I thought,” said K to himself.  \\n\\n\\t“I didn’t mean that the sentence was wrong. It is correct. We use the zero article before the abstract noun peace because we are talking about peace in general.”\\n\\n\\tK scratched his chin.\\n\\n\\t“Too late… Your first answer is always the final answer. The spell-checker owls have already recorded it.”\\n\\n\\t“Tell Woo to stop hurting the flower,” said Q. \\n\\n\\t“As you wish. Woo, leave the flower alone.”\\n\\n\\tWoo dropped it over a bed of black grammatica flowers. With great effort, these flowers opened their petals to cushion the fall of the flower.  \\n\\n\\t“May we carry on?” asked K.  \\n\\n\\t“Yes.” \\n\\n\\t“For the first question, you gave me an incorrect answer.” \\n\\n\\t“I didn’t even answer it.”\\n\\n\\t“Question number two... What is the difference between the past simple and the past perfect?” \\n\\n\\t“I... I don’t know.” \\n\\n\\t“Ha ha... I knew you know nothing of grammar. Go back to school.”\\n\\n\\t“Please, free the Grammar Wizard… What has she done to you?” \\n\\n\\t“Wrong answer!”\\n\\n\\t“Answer the next question for me,” said the flower to Q. \\n\\n\\t“What is the difference between these two sentences? I will rule the Grammar Dimension. I am going to rule the Grammar Dimension.”  \\n\\n\\t“In the first sentence, you are deciding right now that you want to rule the dimension. In the second sentence, you have already decided in the past that you want to rule the dimension, and you are telling me about it right now.”\\n\\n\\tThe three spell-checker owls hooted: “Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Hmm… Your answer is correct. Next question... Is this correct? Before midnight, I will become the Grammar Wizard.” \\n\\n\\t“It’s wrong. It should be in the form of the future perfect tense. Before midnight, I will have become the Grammar Wizard.”  \\n\\n\\t“Are you sure?” asked K. \\n\\n\\t“Yes.”\\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Correct again… I have been to the Word Fields yesterday morning. Is it correct?”\\n\\n\\t“It’s wrong. We can’t use finished time, yesterday morning, with the present perfect. Whenever we use the present perfect, it has to be unfinished time.”\\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\tQ felt the effects of Grammar Potion Number 9. He was also encouraged by the spell-checker owls hooting.   \\n\\n\\t“I hate waiting. Is the word waiting a gerund or a present participle?”\\n\\n\\t“In that sentence, the word waiting acts like a noun. It’s a gerund.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\tK was getting worried. What is happening? When I met Q in the Grand Library, he was not even sure about how to use the present simple tense. Let me see if he can answer the next question.   \\n\\n\\t“Identify this type of sentence. You have learnt a lot of grammar, but it is my destiny to become the Grammar Wizard.” \\n\\n\\t“Both the clauses are independent clauses, and they are joined by a co-ordinating conjunction. It has to be a compound sentence.”\\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Woo! You said Q does not know any grammar. How is he answering all these questions?” said K.\\n\\n\\t“Maybe the grammatica flower are helping him.” \\n\\n\\tK glared at the blue flower which was on the grass.\\n\\n\\t“Of course. That must be it. M must have been telling him the answers. Throw the flower into the river. At once!”\\n\\n\\tAfter snatching the flower from the ground, Woo flung it into the fast-flowing ink. \\n\\n\\t“Listen to me very carefully. I know the flower is your wife. If you answer one more question incorrectly, I will tell Woo to bring her back,” said K, “Decide now. It is important you tell me right now. Look at the river. See how fast the ink flows. Once she is in the Ocean of Ink, it will be too late. She will be lost, forever.”\\n\\n\\tQ saw the blue flower in the red ink. The river’s strong current pressed the flower against a stone. Then the flower was swept away, moving fast – away from Q. \\n\\n\\tHe hoped his friends would arrive in time to save N.\\n\\n\\t“Ask your question.”  \\n\\n\\t“Identify which conditional this is in. If you were me, you would want the Lamp of Grammar.”\\n\\n\\t“It’s in the second conditional. And, I would never want to be you.”  \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Why are you being so unreasonable? All you have to do is answer one question incorrectly, and Woo will rescue your wife.” \\n\\n\\t“The next question.” \\n\\n\\t“Is the use of punctuation correct? Invisible ink is as important as words on a page semicolon because the invisible ink keeps the words in place.” \\n\\n\\t“It’s wrong. A semicolon links two independent clauses. In your sentence, the second clause is a dependant clause.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“If I had studied harder at grammar school, I could have become the Grammar Wizard years ago. Identify which conditional it is in.”  \\n\\n\\t“The third conditional.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!” \\n\\n\\tK glanced at the spell-checker owls. They were keeping score of all the correct and incorrect answers. He knew that he could not influence them. Spell-checkers owls were always honest birds. \\n\\n\\tLeaning into Q, K whispered, “When I become the Grammar Wizard, I can give you whatever you want. Books. Power. Do you want to be the Grand Librarian? Just tell me what you want!”\\n\\n\\tQ did not say a word. K’s lip curled as he read the next question. \\n\\n\\t“Identify the type of dependent clause in this sentence. I am the man that will change the Grammar Dimension forever.”\\n\\n\\t“It contains a relative clause: that will change the Grammar Dimension forever.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Is this correct? The quality of the quill pens are excellent.”\\n\\n\\t“The quality of the quill pens is excellent. The subject of the sentence is quality. The noun pens is part of the prepositional phrase.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\tK thrust his hand into his robe. He brought out a salt shaker and placed it on the ground.\\n\\n\\t“Do you see this? It is filled with anti-grammatical sand. If you correctly answer the next question, I shall tell Woo to sprinkle ALL this anti-grammatical sand ALL over your precious grammatica flowers. They are going to die. DIE! And when the flowers die, the Garden of Grammar will be no more. And Q, it is going to be ALL your fault.”\\n\\n\\t“Ask the last question.”\\n\\n\\tK held the scroll up to read the thirteenth question. A smile spread across his thin face. Even if Q wants to answer this question, he will not be able to. How could someone like him, who has no real understanding of grammar, answer such a profound question? I am certain Wow and P have not prepared him for this kind of question. After all these years of unhappiness, the Lamp of Grammar is mine. Finally.  \\n\\n\\tHe lowered the scroll. His eyes sparkled. With a smirk on his face, he asked the last question. \\n\\n\\t“What is grammar?”\\n\\n\\tThe three owls on the other side of the river strained their ears. They did not want to miss a single syllable. The owl in the middle covered its eyes with its wings.   \\n\\n\\tQ’s shoulders drooped when he heard the last question. He did not have an answer for it. He did not have a clue. He glanced at the delicate flowers around him. If K throws anti-grammatical sand on them, they will surely die. If they die, the Garden of Grammar will be destroyed. The Grammar Dimension will fall back into chaos. All because of me...\\n\\n\\tHe was about to tell K that he did not know the answer. He was about to beg him to free the Grammar Wizard. He was about to plead with him not to use anti-grammatical sand. \\n\\n\\tA flash of light came from the grass. Q squinted at a bunch of green grammatica flowers. His eyes were filled with joy. Wow’s golden spectacles were reflecting sunlight. Q’s friends had finally arrived!\\n\\n\\tClosing his eyes, Q thought about the question. What is grammar? He remembered what Woz told him at the Memory Store: when all else fails, memory can save you. And so, Q recalled all that he had seen and done during his travels across the dimension. He could taste the apple from the Circle of Magic Trees. He recollected the eight parts of speech. He heard the deafening sound of thunder over the Articles Station, and he recollected how some words go with ‘a’ and how some other words go with ‘an’. He saw Woz’s bald head reflecting candlelight in the Memory Store, and he thought about the past continuous tense. Swimming in the cold, salty ink of the Sea of Wishes... Sliding into the Third Conditional Zone... Meeting the Uncountables... Ha telling him about the future time... At the Memory Store, in his grammar dream, even in the Conditional Zones... The words always followed a pattern. There was a structure... He thought about the word-peckers in the Word Fields, and what Wow told him about clauses and phrases. Again, there was always a reason why each word was in its place in a sentence.  \\n\\n\\tK’s eyelids were half closed, as he waited patiently for an incorrect answer. His hands formed a pyramid, with his fingertips lightly pressing against each other. He was already behaving as if he were the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“Grammar shows the relationship between words.”   \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“How could you know that? When I met you, you knew nothing of grammar.”\\n\\n\\tK clenched his teeth. He glanced at the salt shaker near his feet. \\n\\n\\t“Woo… Sprinkle this sand over the flowers. If I cannot have the lamp, then no one else can!”     \\n\\n\\tClutching the salt shaker, the word-pecker flapped about. It swooped down over a bed of terrified grammatica flowers. \\n\\n\\t“Ha, ha, ha,” K laughed out loud.\\n\\n\\tJust as Woo was about to tilt the small holes of the salt shaker downwards, a hairy hand grabbed its beak. Another hairy hand grabbed the salt shaker. \\n\\n\\t“Did someone call me?” asked Ha. \\n\\n\\t“Where did you come from? Bah… I should’ve covered you in sand,” said K.\\n\\n\\tTurning around, the Grand Librarian dashed towards the cottage. He still had some anti-grammatical sand with him. He could use it to hold the Grammar Wizard hostage. While he was running, he took out his pair of gloves. He managed to put one on, but the other one fell to the ground. He did not stop to pick it up. \\n\\n\\tK kicked the door open. The rope lay in a bundle on the chair. The Grammar Wizard, with her arms crossed, stood behind the chair. \\n\\n\\t“P, arrest the Grand Librarian of Biblios.” \\n\\n\\tP picked up the rope.\\n\\n\\t“K, it’s over.”\\n\\n\\tWith his gloved hand, the Grand Librarian took out some sand from his pouch. Spellbound by the silvery sand, P dropped the rope.\\n\\n\\t“Why are you doing this?” asked the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“The Grammar Council just talks and talks and talks. Someone needs to take charge and make decisions on the future of grammar.” \\n\\n\\tK raised his arm to hurl the sand at them. \\n\\n\\t“Once this is over, you’ll understand why I had to do this.” \\n\\n\\tK swung his forearm forward. P jumped in front of the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“There is no place for your sand in my garden,” said Ha, who was in the doorway.                                                      \\n\\n\\tLeaping up, Ha grabbed K’s raised wrist. K pushed Ha back. When K did so, some sand fell onto his forehead. K’s eyes widened in horror. He tried desperately to remove the sand from his face. He crumpled to the floor.  \\n\\n\\tHa, the guardian of the Garden of Grammar, did not move. There was still some anti-grammatical sand in K’s hand. And there was more sand in K’s pouch, which was now on the floor. Ha rushed outside and returned wearing K’s other glove. He took the sand from K’s hand and put it in the pouch. He tied the pouch. Everyone sighed in relief.\\n\\n\\t“What should we do with all this anti-grammatical sand?” asked Ha. \\n\\n\\t“There is a spell to reverse it. It is in The Grammar of Spells,” said the Grammar Wizard.\\n\\n\\t“Wow knows where the book is,” said P. \\n\\n\\t“Will K lose his knowledge of grammar?” asked the Grammar Wizard.\\n\\n\\t“Not at all... Just a few grains of sand touched him,” said Ha. \\n\\n\\t“I would like to have a chat with him after he wakes up,” said the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\tIn the garden, Q was on his hands and knees.  \\n\\n\\t“Wow, where are you?”\\n\\n\\t“I’m right here on your shoulder. I just spoke with the spell-checker owls. They said you answered the questions brilliantly. As for K’s last question, I crossed all my legs. And I fell down!” \\n\\n\\t“My wife, N… The grammatica flower… She’s in the river.” \\n\\n\\t“Let’s hurry.” \\n\\n\\tThe balloon flew over the restless river. When he looked at the horizon, Q saw a cliff. From this cliff, the River of Red Ink plunged into the ocean. The roar of the red ink crashing into the ocean sent shivers down his spine. \\n\\n\\tThe balloon landed with a thud. He tumbled out of the basket. His eyes searched the raging ink. There was no sign of a flower.   \\n\\n\\tAt the edge of the cliff, there were three people. They were gazing at the Ocean of Ink. In this part of the ocean, all the ink was red. The sun lit up thin red clouds which were on the horizon. \\n\\n\\tThe three people were talking with one another. Q recognised them.   \\n\\n\\tRunning towards them, he shouted, “I did it! I did it!”\\n\\n\\tA lady with a pencil in her hair turned around. It was Maz. The other two people turned around as well. They were Woz and the Leader of the Uncountables. Everyone had dark circles under their eyes.  \\n\\n\\tTears of joy streamed down their cheeks. The Leader of the Uncountables always had three grey silk handkerchiefs. He gave one to Woz and one to Maz. \\n\\n\\tQ was out of breath when he reached them.\\n\\n\\t“We were standing here, not knowing what to do. We are so proud of you,” said Maz.\\n\\n\\tQ said, “Oh Woz… Thank you for telling me about the importance of memory. Your words saved me.”\\n\\n\\t“Well, I’m overjoyed that you umm... remembered!” said Woz.   \\n\\n\\t“I could never have done this without all of you. You believed in me, even when…” said Q. \\n\\n\\t“Stay with us and watch the sunset,” said the Leader of the Uncountables.   \\n\\n\\tQ wiped the tears from his cheeks. \\n\\n\\t“I’m searching for a flower. I…I fear it is already in the ocean. I don’t know…”  \\n\\n\\t“A grammatica flower called out to me. I do not know how, or why, but it did,” said Maz. \\n\\n\\t“We managed to catch it before it fell into the ocean,” said Woz.\\n\\n\\tMaz was holding a basket. In it was a blue flower. \\n\\n\\t“It is my wife,” said Q.\\n\\n\\t“The flower is in pain. The Grammar Wizard will know what to do,” said the Leader of the Uncountables, “Leave immediately.”\\n\\n\\tQ and Wow left with the flower. Maz, Woz, and the Leader of the Uncountables waved at the balloon as it rose into the air. \\n\\n\\tWoz said, “After you finish crying, give me your handkerchiefs. I never want to forget this moment.” \\n\\n\\t“Oh Woz,” said Maz, “You and your memory jars.”      \\n\\n\\tThe balloon landed near the cottage. The door was wide open. The Grammar Wizard was sitting on her rocking chair. P and Ha were on the orange sofa. Ha held Woo, the word-pecker, tightly. Woo looked glum.  \\n\\n\\tQ, with trembling hands, kneeled before the Grammar Wizard.\\n\\n\\t“Please, please help me! N is a grammatica flower.”\\n\\n\\t“Place the flower on the carpet.” \\n\\n\\tThe Grammar Wizard chanted a spell: \\n\\n\\tIn the name of all grammatical creatures, and the Garden of Grammar;\\n\\n\\tIn the name of all the four rivers of visible ink, and the Dimension Mountain Range;\\n\\n\\tIn the name of all the eight parts of speech, and the Circle of Magic Trees; \\n\\n\\tIn the name of the Second Conditional, and all things unreal; \\n\\n\\tRestore this person to her original form!\\n\\n\\tPoof! N was before them. She smiled weakly, but her legs had no strength. Q caught her as she fell. He sprinkled some cold black ink on her face. \\n\\n\\tN mumbled, “Foo… Foo… Food.” \\n\\n\\tThe Grammar Wizard went into the kitchen and heated a pan. She fried two commas in it. She flipped the commas in the pan. The commas were cooked in a minute. After eating the commas and drinking a mixture of warm green and black ink, N felt much better.\\n\\n\\tQ told them how he had answered the thirteenth question. P said he was so happy that he had taken Q to all the four corners of the dimension. They were all relieved that everything ended well.\\n\\n\\tThe Grammar Wizard went to the bookshelf to take the lamp. She lit it and placed it on the round table. The soft light from the lamp lit her kind, intelligent face. It was the first time Q noticed the Lamp of Grammar. \\n\\n\\t“I have something to say.

Grinning at P, she carefully removed her wig. P wondered what the Grammar Wizard was doing. She peeled off the dot on her chin.  \\n\\n\\t“Now, do you recognise me?” \\n\\n\\t“How is this… possible?” said P.\\n\\n\\t“You men are so easy to fool,” said X, the Grammar Wizard, with a wink.\\n\\n\\t“Your eyebrows…  just like X… I mean… You are the…” \\n\\n\\tP had served the Grammar Wizard for two decades. He needed some time to get over this shock. \\n\\n\\t“As I was saying,” said the Grammar Wizard, “I am planning to retire soon. I have spoken with the magic trees. They are preparing questions for a competition which is open to all. The winner will be presented with this lamp. And she or he will be the next Grammar Wizard.” \\n\\n\\t“How can I enrol in the test? Ah... Before that, I need to go to the Third Conditional Zone to get some more Grammar Potion Number 9,” said Q.\\n\\n\\t“Your grammar potion has no magic in it whatsoever. It’s pomegranate juice,” said the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“But I saw the secret ingredient,” said Q. \\n\\n\\t“The secret ingredient is a mixture of cinnamon and sugar,” said N. \\n\\n\\t“And what about those green ice cubes which floated in the air?” asked Q. \\n\\n\\t“There must have been invisible ink in the bowl,” replied P, with a shrug. \\n\\n\\tEveryone, except Q, laughed.\\n\\n\\t“How could you not tell me? Well, come to think of it, it was probably better I didn’t know the truth. Anyways, I still want to be the next Grammar Wizard,” said Q.\\n\\n\\t“Darling, you’ve done so much already,” said N, “Let me become the Grammar Wizard, and you can be my assistant.”\\n\\n\\t“That does seem to be the pattern,” said P, still looking a bit lost.\\n\\n\\t“What do you have to say about all this, Wow?” asked Q. \\n\\n\\tThe bookworm was busy making notes on a sheet of paper. \\n\\n\\t“What are you doing?” asked N.\\n\\n\\t“I’m writing a book on how Q saved the garden. The story will be full of excitement and grammar,” replied Wow.\\n\\n\\t“Have you thought of a title yet?” asked N. \\n\\n“I’m finding it difficult to come up with a one. The title should somehow sum up all that Q has seen… All that we have done… All that we have gone through,” said Wow.\\n\\n\\tSmiling, N snapped her fingers.\\n\\n\\t“I might just have a title for you.”\\n\\n\\t“What would that be?” asked the Grammar Wizard, raising an eyebrow. \\n\\n\\tP, Q, and Ha leaned forward. Even Woo looked up. And Wow waited on a page.    \\n\\n\\tN whispered, “Q and the Magic of Grammar.” \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n213']"

      "text/plain": "ll-checker owls perched on a branch of an oak tree. In the tree, there was a hole. And in the hole, there was a scroll.   \\n\\n\\t“I want to get this over and done with. Don’t look so worried. Soon you will be with your precious flower. Q of Alphabet village… Are you ready for the first question?” asked K. \\n\\n\\t“Yes.”     \\n\\n\\tThe three spell-checker owls nodded at each other. Clutching the edge of the scroll in its beak, an owl pulled the scroll out of the tree. The owl flew to the other side of the river, and it let go of the scroll when it was above K’s eager hands.  \\n\\n\\t“The thirteen questions... These were prepared by a committee of spell-checker owls. I had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all,” said K.\\n\\n\\tHe broke the red seal and unfurled the scroll. \\n\\n\\t“The first question is about the zero article. Is this correct? We believe in peace.” \\n\\n\\tThe word-pecker hovered above K. In its beak was the special grammatica flower. The bird bit hard into the flower’s stem.\\n\\n\\tQ cried out, “No!” \\n\\n\\t“This is going to be easier than I thought,” said K to himself.  \\n\\n\\t“I didn’t mean that the sentence was wrong. It is correct. We use the zero article before the abstract noun peace because we are talking about peace in general.”\\n\\n\\tK scratched his chin.\\n\\n\\t“Too late… Your first answer is always the final answer. The spell-checker owls have already recorded it.”\\n\\n\\t“Tell Woo to stop hurting the flower,” said Q. \\n\\n\\t“As you wish. Woo, leave the flower alone.”\\n\\n\\tWoo dropped it over a bed of black grammatica flowers. With great effort, these flowers opened their petals to cushion the fall of the flower.  \\n\\n\\t“May we carry on?” asked K.  \\n\\n\\t“Yes.” \\n\\n\\t“For the first question, you gave me an incorrect answer.” \\n\\n\\t“I didn’t even answer it.”\\n\\n\\t“Question number two... What is the difference between the past simple and the past perfect?” \\n\\n\\t“I... I don’t know.” \\n\\n\\t“Ha ha... I knew you know nothing of grammar. Go back to school.”\\n\\n\\t“Please, free the Grammar Wizard… What has she done to you?” \\n\\n\\t“Wrong answer!”\\n\\n\\t“Answer the next question for me,” said the flower to Q. \\n\\n\\t“What is the difference between these two sentences? I will rule the Grammar Dimension. I am going to rule the Grammar Dimension.”  \\n\\n\\t“In the first sentence, you are deciding right now that you want to rule the dimension. In the second sentence, you have already decided in the past that you want to rule the dimension, and you are telling me about it right now.”\\n\\n\\tThe three spell-checker owls hooted: “Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Hmm… Your answer is correct. Next question... Is this correct? Before midnight, I will become the Grammar Wizard.” \\n\\n\\t“It’s wrong. It should be in the form of the future perfect tense. Before midnight, I will have become the Grammar Wizard.”  \\n\\n\\t“Are you sure?” asked K. \\n\\n\\t“Yes.”\\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Correct again… I have been to the Word Fields yesterday morning. Is it correct?”\\n\\n\\t“It’s wrong. We can’t use finished time, yesterday morning, with the present perfect. Whenever we use the present perfect, it has to be unfinished time.”\\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\tQ felt the effects of Grammar Potion Number 9. He was also encouraged by the spell-checker owls hooting.   \\n\\n\\t“I hate waiting. Is the word waiting a gerund or a present participle?”\\n\\n\\t“In that sentence, the word waiting acts like a noun. It’s a gerund.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\tK was getting worried. What is happening? When I met Q in the Grand Library, he was not even sure about how to use the present simple tense. Let me see if he can answer the next question.   \\n\\n\\t“Identify this type of sentence. You have learnt a lot of grammar, but it is my destiny to become the Grammar Wizard.” \\n\\n\\t“Both the clauses are independent clauses, and they are joined by a co-ordinating conjunction. It has to be a compound sentence.”\\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Woo! You said Q does not know any grammar. How is he answering all these questions?” said K.\\n\\n\\t“Maybe the grammatica flower are helping him.” \\n\\n\\tK glared at the blue flower which was on the grass.\\n\\n\\t“Of course. That must be it. M must have been telling him the answers. Throw the flower into the river. At once!”\\n\\n\\tAfter snatching the flower from the ground, Woo flung it into the fast-flowing ink. \\n\\n\\t“Listen to me very carefully. I know the flower is your wife. If you answer one more question incorrectly, I will tell Woo to bring her back,” said K, “Decide now. It is important you tell me right now. Look at the river. See how fast the ink flows. Once she is in the Ocean of Ink, it will be too late. She will be lost, forever.”\\n\\n\\tQ saw the blue flower in the red ink. The river’s strong current pressed the flower against a stone. Then the flower was swept away, moving fast – away from Q. \\n\\n\\tHe hoped his friends would arrive in time to save N.\\n\\n\\t“Ask your question.”  \\n\\n\\t“Identify which conditional this is in. If you were me, you would want the Lamp of Grammar.”\\n\\n\\t“It’s in the second conditional. And, I would never want to be you.”  \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Why are you being so unreasonable? All you have to do is answer one question incorrectly, and Woo will rescue your wife.” \\n\\n\\t“The next question.” \\n\\n\\t“Is the use of punctuation correct? Invisible ink is as important as words on a page semicolon because the invisible ink keeps the words in place.” \\n\\n\\t“It’s wrong. A semicolon links two independent clauses. In your sentence, the second clause is a dependant clause.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“If I had studied harder at grammar school, I could have become the Grammar Wizard years ago. Identify which conditional it is in.”  \\n\\n\\t“The third conditional.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!” \\n\\n\\tK glanced at the spell-checker owls. They were keeping score of all the correct and incorrect answers. He knew that he could not influence them. Spell-checkers owls were always honest birds. \\n\\n\\tLeaning into Q, K whispered, “When I become the Grammar Wizard, I can give you whatever you want. Books. Power. Do you want to be the Grand Librarian? Just tell me what you want!”\\n\\n\\tQ did not say a word. K’s lip curled as he read the next question. \\n\\n\\t“Identify the type of dependent clause in this sentence. I am the man that will change the Grammar Dimension forever.”\\n\\n\\t“It contains a relative clause: that will change the Grammar Dimension forever.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Is this correct? The quality of the quill pens are excellent.”\\n\\n\\t“The quality of the quill pens is excellent. The subject of the sentence is quality. The noun pens is part of the prepositional phrase.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\tK thrust his hand into his robe. He brought out a salt shaker and placed it on the ground.\\n\\n\\t“Do you see this? It is filled with anti-grammatical sand. If you correctly answer the next question, I shall tell Woo to sprinkle ALL this anti-grammatical sand ALL over your precious grammatica flowers. They are going to die. DIE! And when the flowers die, the Garden of Grammar will be no more. And Q, it is going to be ALL your fault.”\\n\\n\\t“Ask the last question.”\\n\\n\\tK held the scroll up to read the thirteenth question. A smile spread across his thin face. Even if Q wants to answer this question, he will not be able to. How could someone like him, who has no real understanding of grammar, answer such a profound question? I am certain Wow and P have not prepared him for this kind of question. After all these years of unhappiness, the Lamp of Grammar is mine. Finally.  \\n\\n\\tHe lowered the scroll. His eyes sparkled. With a smirk on his face, he asked the last question. \\n\\n\\t“What is grammar?”\\n\\n\\tThe three owls on the other side of the river strained their ears. They did not want to miss a single syllable. The owl in the middle covered its eyes with its wings.   \\n\\n\\tQ’s shoulders drooped when he heard the last question. He did not have an answer for it. He did not have a clue. He glanced at the delicate flowers around him. If K throws anti-grammatical sand on them, they will surely die. If they die, the Garden of Grammar will be destroyed. The Grammar Dimension will fall back into chaos. All because of me...\\n\\n\\tHe was about to tell K that he did not know the answer. He was about to beg him to free the Grammar Wizard. He was about to plead with him not to use anti-grammatical sand. \\n\\n\\tA flash of light came from the grass. Q squinted at a bunch of green grammatica flowers. His eyes were filled with joy. Wow’s golden spectacles were reflecting sunlight. Q’s friends had finally arrived!\\n\\n\\tClosing his eyes, Q thought about the question. What is grammar? He remembered what Woz told him at the Memory Store: when all else fails, memory can save you. And so, Q recalled all that he had seen and done during his travels across the dimension. He could taste the apple from the Circle of Magic Trees. He recollected the eight parts of speech. He heard the deafening sound of thunder over the Articles Station, and he recollected how some words go with ‘a’ and how some other words go with ‘an’. He saw Woz’s bald head reflecting candlelight in the Memory Store, and he thought about the past continuous tense. Swimming in the cold, salty ink of the Sea of Wishes... Sliding into the Third Conditional Zone... Meeting the Uncountables... Ha telling him about the future time... At the Memory Store, in his grammar dream, even in the Conditional Zones... The words always followed a pattern. There was a structure... He thought about the word-peckers in the Word Fields, and what Wow told him about clauses and phrases. Again, there was always a reason why each word was in its place in a sentence.  \\n\\n\\tK’s eyelids were half closed, as he waited patiently for an incorrect answer. His hands formed a pyramid, with his fingertips lightly pressing against each other. He was already behaving as if he were the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“Grammar shows the relationship between words.”   \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“How could you know that? When I met you, you knew nothing of grammar.”\\n\\n\\tK clenched his teeth. He glanced at the salt shaker near his feet. \\n\\n\\t“Woo… Sprinkle this sand over the flowers. If I cannot have the lamp, then no one else can!”     \\n\\n\\tClutching the salt shaker, the word-pecker flapped about. It swooped down over a bed of terrified grammatica flowers. \\n\\n\\t“Ha, ha, ha,” K laughed out loud.\\n\\n\\tJust as Woo was about to tilt the small holes of the salt shaker downwards, a hairy hand grabbed its beak. Another hairy hand grabbed the salt shaker. \\n\\n\\t“Did someone call me?” asked Ha. \\n\\n\\t“Where did you come from? Bah… I should’ve covered you in sand,” said K.\\n\\n\\tTurning around, the Grand Librarian dashed towards the cottage. He still had some anti-grammatical sand with him. He could use it to hold the Grammar Wizard hostage. While he was running, he took out his pair of gloves. He managed to put one on, but the other one fell to the ground. He did not stop to pick it up. \\n\\n\\tK kicked the door open. The rope lay in a bundle on the chair. The Grammar Wizard, with her arms crossed, stood behind the chair. \\n\\n\\t“P, arrest the Grand Librarian of Biblios.” \\n\\n\\tP picked up the rope.\\n\\n\\t“K, it’s over.”\\n\\n\\tWith his gloved hand, the Grand Librarian took out some sand from his pouch. Spellbound by the silvery sand, P dropped the rope.\\n\\n\\t“Why are you doing this?” asked the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“The Grammar Council just talks and talks and talks. Someone needs to take charge and make decisions on the future of grammar.” \\n\\n\\tK raised his arm to hurl the sand at them. \\n\\n\\t“Once this is over, you’ll understand why I had to do this.” \\n\\n\\tK swung his forearm forward. P jumped in front of the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“There is no place for your sand in my garden,” said Ha, who was in the doorway.                                                      \\n\\n\\tLeaping up, Ha grabbed K’s raised wrist. K pushed Ha back. When K did so, some sand fell onto his forehead. K’s eyes widened in horror. He tried desperately to remove the sand from his face. He crumpled to the floor.  \\n\\n\\tHa, the guardian of the Garden of Grammar, did not move. There was still some anti-grammatical sand in K’s hand. And there was more sand in K’s pouch, which was now on the floor. Ha rushed outside and returned wearing K’s other glove. He took the sand from K’s hand and put it in the pouch. He tied the pouch. Everyone sighed in relief.\\n\\n\\t“What should we do with all this anti-grammatical sand?” asked Ha. \\n\\n\\t“There is a spell to reverse it. It is in The Grammar of Spells,” said the Grammar Wizard.\\n\\n\\t“Wow knows where the book is,” said P. \\n\\n\\t“Will K lose his knowledge of grammar?” asked the Grammar Wizard.\\n\\n\\t“Not at all... Just a few grains of sand touched him,” said Ha. \\n\\n\\t“I would like to have a chat with him after he wakes up,” said the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\tIn the garden, Q was on his hands and knees.  \\n\\n\\t“Wow, where are you?”\\n\\n\\t“I’m right here on your shoulder. I just spoke with the spell-checker owls. They said you answered the questions brilliantly. As for K’s last question, I crossed all my legs. And I fell down!” \\n\\n\\t“My wife, N… The grammatica flower… She’s in the river.” \\n\\n\\t“Let’s hurry.” \\n\\n\\tThe balloon flew over the restless river. When he looked at the horizon, Q saw a cliff. From this cliff, the River of Red Ink plunged into the ocean. The roar of the red ink crashing into the ocean sent shivers down his spine. \\n\\n\\tThe balloon landed with a thud. He tumbled out of the basket. His eyes searched the raging ink. There was no sign of a flower.   \\n\\n\\tAt the edge of the cliff, there were three people. They were gazing at the Ocean of Ink. In this part of the ocean, all the ink was red. The sun lit up thin red clouds which were on the horizon. \\n\\n\\tThe three people were talking with one another. Q recognised them.   \\n\\n\\tRunning towards them, he shouted, “I did it! I did it!”\\n\\n\\tA lady with a pencil in her hair turned around. It was Maz. The other two people turned around as well. They were Woz and the Leader of the Uncountables. Everyone had dark circles under their eyes.  \\n\\n\\tTears of joy streamed down their cheeks. The Leader of the Uncountables always had three grey silk handkerchiefs. He gave one to Woz and one to Maz. \\n\\n\\tQ was out of breath when he reached them.\\n\\n\\t“We were standing here, not knowing what to do. We are so proud of you,” said Maz.\\n\\n\\tQ said, “Oh Woz… Thank you for telling me about the importance of memory. Your words saved me.”\\n\\n\\t“Well, I’m overjoyed that you umm... remembered!” said Woz.   \\n\\n\\t“I could never have done this without all of you. You believed in me, even when…” said Q. \\n\\n\\t“Stay with us and watch the sunset,” said the Leader of the Uncountables.   \\n\\n\\tQ wiped the tears from his cheeks. \\n\\n\\t“I’m searching for a flower. I…I fear it is already in the ocean. I don’t know…”  \\n\\n\\t“A grammatica flower called out to me. I do not know how, or why, but it did,” said Maz. \\n\\n\\t“We managed to catch it before it fell into the ocean,” said Woz.\\n\\n\\tMaz was holding a basket. In it was a blue flower. \\n\\n\\t“It is my wife,” said Q.\\n\\n\\t“The flower is in pain. The Grammar Wizard will know what to do,” said the Leader of the Uncountables, “Leave immediately.”\\n\\n\\tQ and Wow left with the flower. Maz, Woz, and the Leader of the Uncountables waved at the balloon as it rose into the air. \\n\\n\\tWoz said, “After you finish crying, give me your handkerchiefs. I never want to forget this moment.” \\n\\n\\t“Oh Woz,” said Maz, “You and your memory jars.”      \\n\\n\\tThe balloon landed near the cottage. The door was wide open. The Grammar Wizard was sitting on her rocking chair. P and Ha were on the orange sofa. Ha held Woo, the word-pecker, tightly. Woo looked glum.  \\n\\n\\tQ, with trembling hands, kneeled before the Grammar Wizard.\\n\\n\\t“Please, please help me! N is a grammatica flower.”\\n\\n\\t“Place the flower on the carpet.” \\n\\n\\tThe Grammar Wizard chanted a spell: \\n\\n\\tIn the name of all grammatical creatures, and the Garden of Grammar;\\n\\n\\tIn the name of all the four rivers of visible ink, and the Dimension Mountain Range;\\n\\n\\tIn the name of all the eight parts of speech, and the Circle of Magic Trees; \\n\\n\\tIn the name of the Second Conditional, and all things unreal; \\n\\n\\tRestore this person to her original form!\\n\\n\\tPoof! N was before them. She smiled weakly, but her legs had no strength. Q caught her as she fell. He sprinkled some cold black ink on her face. \\n\\n\\tN mumbled, “Foo… Foo… Food.” \\n\\n\\tThe Grammar Wizard went into the kitchen and heated a pan. She fried two commas in it. She flipped the commas in the pan. The commas were cooked in a minute. After eating the commas and drinking a mixture of warm green and black ink, N felt much better.\\n\\n\\tQ told them how he had answered the thirteenth question. P said he was so happy that he had taken Q to all the four corners of the dimension. They were all relieved that everything ended well.\\n\\n\\tThe Grammar Wizard went to the bookshelf to take the lamp. She lit it and placed it on the round table. The soft light from the lamp lit her kind, intelligent face. It was the first time Q noticed the Lamp of Grammar. \\n\\n\\t“I have something to say. I am planning to retire,” said the Grammar Wizard.  \\n\\n\\t“Why?” Ha asked. \\n\\n\\t“I want to spend more time with my husband,” she replied. \\n\\n\\tAfter removing her spectacles, she folded them and placed them beside the lamp. Grinning at P, she carefully removed her wig. P wondered what the Grammar Wizard was doing. She peeled off the dot on her chin.  \\n\\n\\t“Now, do you recognise me?” \\n\\n\\t“How is this… possible?” said P.\\n\\n\\t“You men are so easy to fool,” said X, the Grammar Wizard, with a wink.\\n\\n\\t“Your eyebrows…  just like X… I mean… You are the…” \\n\\n\\tP had served the Grammar Wizard for two decades. He needed some time to get over this shock. \\n\\n\\t“As I was saying,” said the Grammar Wizard, “I am planning to retire soon. I have spoken with the magic trees. They are preparing questions for a competition which is open to all. The winner will be presented with this lamp. And she or he will be the next Grammar Wizard.” \\n\\n\\t“How can I enrol in the test? Ah... Before that, I need to go to the Third Conditional Zone to get some more Grammar Potion Number 9,” said Q.\\n\\n\\t“Your grammar potion has no magic in it whatsoever. It’s pomegranate juice,” said the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“But I saw the secret ingredient,” said Q. \\n\\n\\t“The secret ingredient is a mixture of cinnamon and sugar,” said N. \\n\\n\\t“And what about those green ice cubes which floated in the air?” asked Q. \\n\\n\\t“There must have been invisible ink in the bowl,” replied P, with a shrug. \\n\\n\\tEveryone, except Q, laughed.\\n\\n\\t“How could you not tell me? Well, come to think of it, it was probably better I didn’t know the truth. Anyways, I still want to be the next Grammar Wizard,” said Q.\\n\\n\\t“Darling, you’ve done so much already,” said N, “Let me become the Grammar Wizard, and you can be my assistant.”\\n\\n\\t“That does seem to be the pattern,” said P, still looking a bit lost.\\n\\n\\t“What do you have to say about all this, Wow?” asked Q. \\n\\n\\tThe bookworm was busy making notes on a sheet of paper. \\n\\n\\t“What are you doing?” asked N.\\n\\n\\t“I’m writing a book on how Q saved the garden. The story will be full of excitement and grammar,” replied Wow.\\n\\n\\t“Have you thought of a title yet?” asked N. \\n\\n“I’m finding it difficult to come up with a one. The title should somehow sum up all that Q has seen… All that we have done… All that we have gone through,” said Wow.\\n\\n\\tSmiling, N snapped her fingers.\\n\\n\\t“I might just have a title for you.”\\n\\n\\t“What would that be?” asked the Grammar Wizard, raising an eyebrow. \\n\\n\\tP, Q, and Ha leaned forward. Even Woo looked up. And Wow waited on a page.    \\n\\n\\tN whispered, “Q and the Magic of Grammar.” \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n213'])])"

      "text/plain": " spell-checker owls perched on a branch of an oak tree. In the tree, there was a hole. And in the hole, there was a scroll.   \\n\\n\\t“I want to get this over and done with. Don’t look so worried. Soon you will be with your precious flower. Q of Alphabet village… Are you ready for the first question?” asked K. \\n\\n\\t“Yes.”     \\n\\n\\tThe three spell-checker owls nodded at each other. Clutching the edge of the scroll in its beak, an owl pulled the scroll out of the tree. The owl flew to the other side of the river, and it let go of the scroll when it was above K’s eager hands.  \\n\\n\\t“The thirteen questions... These were prepared by a committee of spell-checker owls. I had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all,” said K.\\n\\n\\tHe broke the red seal and unfurled the scroll. \\n\\n\\t“The first question is about the zero article. Is this correct? We believe in peace.” \\n\\n\\tThe word-pecker hovered above K. In its beak was the special grammatica flower. The bird bit hard into the flower’s stem.\\n\\n\\tQ cried out, “No!” \\n\\n\\t“This is going to be easier than I thought,” said K to himself.  \\n\\n\\t“I didn’t mean that the sentence was wrong. It is correct. We use the zero article before the abstract noun peace because we are talking about peace in general.”\\n\\n\\tK scratched his chin.\\n\\n\\t“Too late… Your first answer is always the final answer. The spell-checker owls have already recorded it.”\\n\\n\\t“Tell Woo to stop hurting the flower,” said Q. \\n\\n\\t“As you wish. Woo, leave the flower alone.”\\n\\n\\tWoo dropped it over a bed of black grammatica flowers. With great effort, these flowers opened their petals to cushion the fall of the flower.  \\n\\n\\t“May we carry on?” asked K.  \\n\\n\\t“Yes.” \\n\\n\\t“For the first question, you gave me an incorrect answer.” \\n\\n\\t“I didn’t even answer it.”\\n\\n\\t“Question number two... What is the difference between the past simple and the past perfect?” \\n\\n\\t“I... I don’t know.” \\n\\n\\t“Ha ha... I knew you know nothing of grammar. Go back to school.”\\n\\n\\t“Please, free the Grammar Wizard… What has she done to you?” \\n\\n\\t“Wrong answer!”\\n\\n\\t“Answer the next question for me,” said the flower to Q. \\n\\n\\t“What is the difference between these two sentences? I will rule the Grammar Dimension. I am going to rule the Grammar Dimension.”  \\n\\n\\t“In the first sentence, you are deciding right now that you want to rule the dimension. In the second sentence, you have already decided in the past that you want to rule the dimension, and you are telling me about it right now.”\\n\\n\\tThe three spell-checker owls hooted: “Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Hmm… Your answer is correct. Next question... Is this correct? Before midnight, I will become the Grammar Wizard.” \\n\\n\\t“It’s wrong. It should be in the form of the future perfect tense. Before midnight, I will have become the Grammar Wizard.”  \\n\\n\\t“Are you sure?” asked K. \\n\\n\\t“Yes.”\\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Correct again… I have been to the Word Fields yesterday morning. Is it correct?”\\n\\n\\t“It’s wrong. We can’t use finished time, yesterday morning, with the present perfect. Whenever we use the present perfect, it has to be unfinished time.”\\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\tQ felt the effects of Grammar Potion Number 9. He was also encouraged by the spell-checker owls hooting.   \\n\\n\\t“I hate waiting. Is the word waiting a gerund or a present participle?”\\n\\n\\t“In that sentence, the word waiting acts like a noun. It’s a gerund.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\tK was getting worried. What is happening? When I met Q in the Grand Library, he was not even sure about how to use the present simple tense. Let me see if he can answer the next question.   \\n\\n\\t“Identify this type of sentence. You have learnt a lot of grammar, but it is my destiny to become the Grammar Wizard.” \\n\\n\\t“Both the clauses are independent clauses, and they are joined by a co-ordinating conjunction. It has to be a compound sentence.”\\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Woo! You said Q does not know any grammar. How is he answering all these questions?” said K.\\n\\n\\t“Maybe the grammatica flower are helping him.” \\n\\n\\tK glared at the blue flower which was on the grass.\\n\\n\\t“Of course. That must be it. M must have been telling him the answers. Throw the flower into the river. At once!”\\n\\n\\tAfter snatching the flower from the ground, Woo flung it into the fast-flowing ink. \\n\\n\\t“Listen to me very carefully. I know the flower is your wife. If you answer one more question incorrectly, I will tell Woo to bring her back,” said K, “Decide now. It is important you tell me right now. Look at the river. See how fast the ink flows. Once she is in the Ocean of Ink, it will be too late. She will be lost, forever.”\\n\\n\\tQ saw the blue flower in the red ink. The river’s strong current pressed the flower against a stone. Then the flower was swept away, moving fast – away from Q. \\n\\n\\tHe hoped his friends would arrive in time to save N.\\n\\n\\t“Ask your question.”  \\n\\n\\t“Identify which conditional this is in. If you were me, you would want the Lamp of Grammar.”\\n\\n\\t“It’s in the second conditional. And, I would never want to be you.”  \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Why are you being so unreasonable? All you have to do is answer one question incorrectly, and Woo will rescue your wife.” \\n\\n\\t“The next question.” \\n\\n\\t“Is the use of punctuation correct? Invisible ink is as important as words on a page semicolon because the invisible ink keeps the words in place.” \\n\\n\\t“It’s wrong. A semicolon links two independent clauses. In your sentence, the second clause is a dependant clause.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“If I had studied harder at grammar school, I could have become the Grammar Wizard years ago. Identify which conditional it is in.”  \\n\\n\\t“The third conditional.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!” \\n\\n\\tK glanced at the spell-checker owls. They were keeping score of all the correct and incorrect answers. He knew that he could not influence them. Spell-checkers owls were always honest birds. \\n\\n\\tLeaning into Q, K whispered, “When I become the Grammar Wizard, I can give you whatever you want. Books. Power. Do you want to be the Grand Librarian? Just tell me what you want!”\\n\\n\\tQ did not say a word. K’s lip curled as he read the next question. \\n\\n\\t“Identify the type of dependent clause in this sentence. I am the man that will change the Grammar Dimension forever.”\\n\\n\\t“It contains a relative clause: that will change the Grammar Dimension forever.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“Is this correct? The quality of the quill pens are excellent.”\\n\\n\\t“The quality of the quill pens is excellent. The subject of the sentence is quality. The noun pens is part of the prepositional phrase.” \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\tK thrust his hand into his robe. He brought out a salt shaker and placed it on the ground.\\n\\n\\t“Do you see this? It is filled with anti-grammatical sand. If you correctly answer the next question, I shall tell Woo to sprinkle ALL this anti-grammatical sand ALL over your precious grammatica flowers. They are going to die. DIE! And when the flowers die, the Garden of Grammar will be no more. And Q, it is going to be ALL your fault.”\\n\\n\\t“Ask the last question.”\\n\\n\\tK held the scroll up to read the thirteenth question. A smile spread across his thin face. Even if Q wants to answer this question, he will not be able to. How could someone like him, who has no real understanding of grammar, answer such a profound question? I am certain Wow and P have not prepared him for this kind of question. After all these years of unhappiness, the Lamp of Grammar is mine. Finally.  \\n\\n\\tHe lowered the scroll. His eyes sparkled. With a smirk on his face, he asked the last question. \\n\\n\\t“What is grammar?”\\n\\n\\tThe three owls on the other side of the river strained their ears. They did not want to miss a single syllable. The owl in the middle covered its eyes with its wings.   \\n\\n\\tQ’s shoulders drooped when he heard the last question. He did not have an answer for it. He did not have a clue. He glanced at the delicate flowers around him. If K throws anti-grammatical sand on them, they will surely die. If they die, the Garden of Grammar will be destroyed. The Grammar Dimension will fall back into chaos. All because of me...\\n\\n\\tHe was about to tell K that he did not know the answer. He was about to beg him to free the Grammar Wizard. He was about to plead with him not to use anti-grammatical sand. \\n\\n\\tA flash of light came from the grass. Q squinted at a bunch of green grammatica flowers. His eyes were filled with joy. Wow’s golden spectacles were reflecting sunlight. Q’s friends had finally arrived!\\n\\n\\tClosing his eyes, Q thought about the question. What is grammar? He remembered what Woz told him at the Memory Store: when all else fails, memory can save you. And so, Q recalled all that he had seen and done during his travels across the dimension. He could taste the apple from the Circle of Magic Trees. He recollected the eight parts of speech. He heard the deafening sound of thunder over the Articles Station, and he recollected how some words go with ‘a’ and how some other words go with ‘an’. He saw Woz’s bald head reflecting candlelight in the Memory Store, and he thought about the past continuous tense. Swimming in the cold, salty ink of the Sea of Wishes... Sliding into the Third Conditional Zone... Meeting the Uncountables... Ha telling him about the future time... At the Memory Store, in his grammar dream, even in the Conditional Zones... The words always followed a pattern. There was a structure... He thought about the word-peckers in the Word Fields, and what Wow told him about clauses and phrases. Again, there was always a reason why each word was in its place in a sentence.  \\n\\n\\tK’s eyelids were half closed, as he waited patiently for an incorrect answer. His hands formed a pyramid, with his fingertips lightly pressing against each other. He was already behaving as if he were the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“Grammar shows the relationship between words.”   \\n\\n\\t“Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!”\\n\\n\\t“How could you know that? When I met you, you knew nothing of grammar.”\\n\\n\\tK clenched his teeth. He glanced at the salt shaker near his feet. \\n\\n\\t“Woo… Sprinkle this sand over the flowers. If I cannot have the lamp, then no one else can!”     \\n\\n\\tClutching the salt shaker, the word-pecker flapped about. It swooped down over a bed of terrified grammatica flowers. \\n\\n\\t“Ha, ha, ha,” K laughed out loud.\\n\\n\\tJust as Woo was about to tilt the small holes of the salt shaker downwards, a hairy hand grabbed its beak. Another hairy hand grabbed the salt shaker. \\n\\n\\t“Did someone call me?” asked Ha. \\n\\n\\t“Where did you come from? Bah… I should’ve covered you in sand,” said K.\\n\\n\\tTurning around, the Grand Librarian dashed towards the cottage. He still had some anti-grammatical sand with him. He could use it to hold the Grammar Wizard hostage. While he was running, he took out his pair of gloves. He managed to put one on, but the other one fell to the ground. He did not stop to pick it up. \\n\\n\\tK kicked the door open. The rope lay in a bundle on the chair. The Grammar Wizard, with her arms crossed, stood behind the chair. \\n\\n\\t“P, arrest the Grand Librarian of Biblios.” \\n\\n\\tP picked up the rope.\\n\\n\\t“K, it’s over.”\\n\\n\\tWith his gloved hand, the Grand Librarian took out some sand from his pouch. Spellbound by the silvery sand, P dropped the rope.\\n\\n\\t“Why are you doing this?” asked the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“The Grammar Council just talks and talks and talks. Someone needs to take charge and make decisions on the future of grammar.” \\n\\n\\tK raised his arm to hurl the sand at them. \\n\\n\\t“Once this is over, you’ll understand why I had to do this.” \\n\\n\\tK swung his forearm forward. P jumped in front of the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“There is no place for your sand in my garden,” said Ha, who was in the doorway.                                                      \\n\\n\\tLeaping up, Ha grabbed K’s raised wrist. K pushed Ha back. When K did so, some sand fell onto his forehead. K’s eyes widened in horror. He tried desperately to remove the sand from his face. He crumpled to the floor.  \\n\\n\\tHa, the guardian of the Garden of Grammar, did not move. There was still some anti-grammatical sand in K’s hand. And there was more sand in K’s pouch, which was now on the floor. Ha rushed outside and returned wearing K’s other glove. He took the sand from K’s hand and put it in the pouch. He tied the pouch. Everyone sighed in relief.\\n\\n\\t“What should we do with all this anti-grammatical sand?” asked Ha. \\n\\n\\t“There is a spell to reverse it. It is in The Grammar of Spells,” said the Grammar Wizard.\\n\\n\\t“Wow knows where the book is,” said P. \\n\\n\\t“Will K lose his knowledge of grammar?” asked the Grammar Wizard.\\n\\n\\t“Not at all... Just a few grains of sand touched him,” said Ha. \\n\\n\\t“I would like to have a chat with him after he wakes up,” said the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\tIn the garden, Q was on his hands and knees.  \\n\\n\\t“Wow, where are you?”\\n\\n\\t“I’m right here on your shoulder. I just spoke with the spell-checker owls. They said you answered the questions brilliantly. As for K’s last question, I crossed all my legs. And I fell down!” \\n\\n\\t“My wife, N… The grammatica flower… She’s in the river.” \\n\\n\\t“Let’s hurry.” \\n\\n\\tThe balloon flew over the restless river. When he looked at the horizon, Q saw a cliff. From this cliff, the River of Red Ink plunged into the ocean. The roar of the red ink crashing into the ocean sent shivers down his spine. \\n\\n\\tThe balloon landed with a thud. He tumbled out of the basket. His eyes searched the raging ink. There was no sign of a flower.   \\n\\n\\tAt the edge of the cliff, there were three people. They were gazing at the Ocean of Ink. In this part of the ocean, all the ink was red. The sun lit up thin red clouds which were on the horizon. \\n\\n\\tThe three people were talking with one another. Q recognised them.   \\n\\n\\tRunning towards them, he shouted, “I did it! I did it!”\\n\\n\\tA lady with a pencil in her hair turned around. It was Maz. The other two people turned around as well. They were Woz and the Leader of the Uncountables. Everyone had dark circles under their eyes.  \\n\\n\\tTears of joy streamed down their cheeks. The Leader of the Uncountables always had three grey silk handkerchiefs. He gave one to Woz and one to Maz. \\n\\n\\tQ was out of breath when he reached them.\\n\\n\\t“We were standing here, not knowing what to do. We are so proud of you,” said Maz.\\n\\n\\tQ said, “Oh Woz… Thank you for telling me about the importance of memory. Your words saved me.”\\n\\n\\t“Well, I’m overjoyed that you umm... remembered!” said Woz.   \\n\\n\\t“I could never have done this without all of you. You believed in me, even when…” said Q. \\n\\n\\t“Stay with us and watch the sunset,” said the Leader of the Uncountables.   \\n\\n\\tQ wiped the tears from his cheeks. \\n\\n\\t“I’m searching for a flower. I…I fear it is already in the ocean. I don’t know…”  \\n\\n\\t“A grammatica flower called out to me. I do not know how, or why, but it did,” said Maz. \\n\\n\\t“We managed to catch it before it fell into the ocean,” said Woz.\\n\\n\\tMaz was holding a basket. In it was a blue flower. \\n\\n\\t“It is my wife,” said Q.\\n\\n\\t“The flower is in pain. The Grammar Wizard will know what to do,” said the Leader of the Uncountables, “Leave immediately.”\\n\\n\\tQ and Wow left with the flower. Maz, Woz, and the Leader of the Uncountables waved at the balloon as it rose into the air. \\n\\n\\tWoz said, “After you finish crying, give me your handkerchiefs. I never want to forget this moment.” \\n\\n\\t“Oh Woz,” said Maz, “You and your memory jars.”      \\n\\n\\tThe balloon landed near the cottage. The door was wide open. The Grammar Wizard was sitting on her rocking chair. P and Ha were on the orange sofa. Ha held Woo, the word-pecker, tightly. Woo looked glum.  \\n\\n\\tQ, with trembling hands, kneeled before the Grammar Wizard.\\n\\n\\t“Please, please help me! N is a grammatica flower.”\\n\\n\\t“Place the flower on the carpet.” \\n\\n\\tThe Grammar Wizard chanted a spell: \\n\\n\\tIn the name of all grammatical creatures, and the Garden of Grammar;\\n\\n\\tIn the name of all the four rivers of visible ink, and the Dimension Mountain Range;\\n\\n\\tIn the name of all the eight parts of speech, and the Circle of Magic Trees; \\n\\n\\tIn the name of the Second Conditional, and all things unreal; \\n\\n\\tRestore this person to her original form!\\n\\n\\tPoof! N was before them. She smiled weakly, but her legs had no strength. Q caught her as she fell. He sprinkled some cold black ink on her face. \\n\\n\\tN mumbled, “Foo… Foo… Food.” \\n\\n\\tThe Grammar Wizard went into the kitchen and heated a pan. She fried two commas in it. She flipped the commas in the pan. The commas were cooked in a minute. After eating the commas and drinking a mixture of warm green and black ink, N felt much better.\\n\\n\\tQ told them how he had answered the thirteenth question. P said he was so happy that he had taken Q to all the four corners of the dimension. They were all relieved that everything ended well.\\n\\n\\tThe Grammar Wizard went to the bookshelf to take the lamp. She lit it and placed it on the round table. The soft light from the lamp lit her kind, intelligent face. It was the first time Q noticed the Lamp of Grammar. \\n\\n\\t“I have something to say. I am planning to retire,” said the Grammar Wizard.  \\n\\n\\t“Why?” Ha asked. \\n\\n\\t“I want to spend more time with my husband,” she replied. \\n\\n\\tAfter removing her spectacles, she folded them and placed them beside the lamp. Grinning at P, she carefully removed her wig. P wondered what the Grammar Wizard was doing. She peeled off the dot on her chin.  \\n\\n\\t“Now, do you recognise me?” \\n\\n\\t“How is this… possible?” said P.\\n\\n\\t“You men are so easy to fool,” said X, the Grammar Wizard, with a wink.\\n\\n\\t“Your eyebrows…  just like X… I mean… You are the…” \\n\\n\\tP had served the Grammar Wizard for two decades. He needed some time to get over this shock. \\n\\n\\t“As I was saying,” said the Grammar Wizard, “I am planning to retire soon. I have spoken with the magic trees. They are preparing questions for a competition which is open to all. The winner will be presented with this lamp. And she or he will be the next Grammar Wizard.” \\n\\n\\t“How can I enrol in the test? Ah... Before that, I need to go to the Third Conditional Zone to get some more Grammar Potion Number 9,” said Q.\\n\\n\\t“Your grammar potion has no magic in it whatsoever. It’s pomegranate juice,” said the Grammar Wizard. \\n\\n\\t“But I saw the secret ingredient,” said Q. \\n\\n\\t“The secret ingredient is a mixture of cinnamon and sugar,” said N. \\n\\n\\t“And what about those green ice cubes which floated in the air?” asked Q. \\n\\n\\t“There must have been invisible ink in the bowl,” replied P, with a shrug. \\n\\n\\tEveryone, except Q, laughed.\\n\\n\\t“How could you not tell me? Well, come to think of it, it was probably better I didn’t know the truth. Anyways, I still want to be the next Grammar Wizard,” said Q.\\n\\n\\t“Darling, you’ve done so much already,” said N, “Let me become the Grammar Wizard, and you can be my assistant.”\\n\\n\\t“That does seem to be the pattern,” said P, still looking a bit lost.\\n\\n\\t“What do you have to say about all this, Wow?” asked Q. \\n\\n\\tThe bookworm was busy making notes on a sheet of paper. \\n\\n\\t“What are you doing?” asked N.\\n\\n\\t“I’m writing a book on how Q saved the garden. The story will be full of excitement and grammar,” replied Wow.\\n\\n\\t“Have you thought of a title yet?” asked N. \\n\\n“I’m finding it difficult to come up with a one. The title should somehow sum up all that Q has seen… All that we have done… All that we have gone through,” said Wow.\\n\\n\\tSmiling, N snapped her fingers.\\n\\n\\t“I might just have a title for you.”\\n\\n\\t“What would that be?” asked the Grammar Wizard, raising an eyebrow. \\n\\n\\tP, Q, and Ha leaned forward. Even Woo looked up. And Wow waited on a page.    \\n\\n\\tN whispered, “Q and the Magic of Grammar.” \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n213'"
